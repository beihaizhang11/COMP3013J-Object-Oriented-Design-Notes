## Question 1

### a.
Top-down implementation starts with the higher
components and proceeds **downwards** in the direction of the dependency arrows
* Advantage: **overall design** of the system can be tested early in the process
* Disadvantage: **stubs**, or temporary implementations, need to be created for lower level classes

Bottom-up implementation starts with the lower level classes and proceeds up the diagram
* Advantage: This approach makes the **development** and **testing** of individual components easier
* Disadvantage: runs the risk of **postponing** a complete executable program until quite a late stage in implementation

### b.

### c.
An object A can call a method of an object instance B. But object A should not ”reach through” object B to access another object, C, to call its method. Instead, B’s interface should be modified so it can directly serve A’s request, propagating it to any relevant subcomponents. Alternatively, A might have a direct reference to object C and make the request directly to that.

In simple words, The fundamental idea is that an object should **know about** and **interact** with a few other classes as possible

### d.
A statechart should be developed for a class when the object's responses to events/messages **vary** based on its **current state**.

A State Machine Diagram is used to represent the **condition** of the system or part of the system at finite instances of time.
