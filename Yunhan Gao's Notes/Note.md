# 01-UML
## The Unified Modelling Language (UML)
Def: UML is the dominant modelling language in industry which efines a language for modelling systems.
### Type of UML
- **Class diagram**
- **Sequence diagram**
- **Use case diagram**
- **Object diagram**
- Collaboration diagram
- Statechart diagram
- Activity diagram
- Component diagram
- Deployment diagram

# 02-Processes
## Waterfall model
![](./Pic/屏幕截图%202024-12-19%20221242.png)

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| Clear structure with milestones | Management of risk in projects |
| Documentation read for the next stage | Treatment of requirements |
### More disadvantages
- Planned testing is very late in the waterfall model
- If a large problem is discovered, we may need to return to analysis, design or coding and repeat a lot of work
- There is no limit to the cost of solving the problem

### Hard to gathering requirements 
1. The requirements of many systems are complex
2. Environment of the software may change during development
3. Involvement in the process can change the requirements

## Iterative and Incremental Development
### Iterative Development
- development is organised as a repeated completion of the development activities
### Incremental development
- Here the focus of the development is initially developing a prototype
- Then subsequent phases will add new functionality to the prototype or improve the existing functionality

### Compare and Contrast
- Compare: These two ideas are very compatible, both break development into iterations but have a different focus.
- Constrast: 
    - Iterative development is focused on the organisation of different activities
    - Incremental development is focused on what functionality is developed and when

## Unified Process
- UP includes activities such as requirements analysis,  analysis, design, implementation, and testing.
- UP assumes that models are important in software development

## Other
- Extreme Programming (XP) makelittle use of models
- XP does not recommend the use of models in the same way as UP
- XP is often thought of as being anti-model

## Use of UML in The Unified Process
### Domain model
- This is a very basic class diagram
