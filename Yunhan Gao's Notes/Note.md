![](./Pic/屏幕截图%202024-12-19%20221242.png)

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| Clear structure with milestones | Management of risk in projects |
| Documentation read for the next stage | Treatment of requirements |
### More disadvantages
- Planned testing is very late in the waterfall model
- If a large problem is discovered, we may need to return to analysis, design or coding and repeat a lot of work
- There is no limit to the cost of solving the problem

### Hard to gathering requirements 
1. The requirements of many systems are complex
2. Environment of the software may change during development
3. Involvement in the process can change the requirements

## Iterative and Incremental Development
### Iterative Development
- development is organised as a repeated completion of the development activities
### Incremental development
- Here the focus of the development is initially developing a prototype
- Then subsequent phases will add new functionality to the prototype or improve the existing functionality
