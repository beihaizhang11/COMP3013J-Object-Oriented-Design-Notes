### Q1 a

Static diagrams describe the **properties** the object network can have, it shows the **structure** of system and how different elements or components are related to each. (Class diagram）

Dynamic diagrams describe what **happens** in object network, it describe the **behavior** of the system.  (Sequence Diagram)

### Q1 b

Iterative development focus on the organization of different activities.

Incremental development focus on what functionality is developed and when.

### Q1 c

Include Relationship is used to represent functionality that common to multiple use cases. It allows a use case to "include" relationship to reduce redundancy and make it reusable.

### Q1 d

High-level interactions are developed for each use case/course of events.

It shows how task will achieved with the classed/objects we have defined. 

Any new classes or updates to attributes and operations will be added to the class diagram. Sequence diagrams will be created to show the interaction between objects.

### Q1 h

Object or entities should be open for extension. but closed to modification.

Closing a module means it is a stable component of the system, closed module can't be modified.

Open module means it is allows extension without modifying its source code.

It will make it possible to extend function to a system without altering existing code.

### Q3 a

Testing is the best way of finding problems in large-scale software. It ensures that system meets its function and non-function requirements. Testing also ensure the system reliability and robustness. and minimize costly failures.

In the waterfall model, planned testing is too late. If a large problem is discovered, developer need to return the analysis, design and code, while repeat lot of work.

In the UP, testing is integrated throughout the development lifecycle. Testing is in each iteration, allowing for continuous feedback and validation of system.

Late defect detection is minimize, as it UP allow continuous testing in each iteration.

### Q3 b

*List and describe briefly the 4 quadrants of the spiral model. How does the spiral model compare to the waterfall model in terms of the risk of the project and management overhead.* 

> 我觉得不考，以防万一准备一下。

(ORDP)

Objective Setting: Define goals, alternatives, and constraints for the phase.

Risk Assessment: Identify risks and plan mitigation strategies.

Development and Validation: Build and test deliverables.

Planning the next Iteration: Review and plan the next iteration.

Risk: Spiral is lower risk as it proactive risk management. Waterfall model is Higher risk due to risks detect late.

Management: Spiral is high management overhead, as it needs iterative planning. Waterfall model is lower overhead, due to it has phases step by step.

### Q1 a

Top-down implementation start with the highest components and proceeds downwards in the direction of the dependency arrows. Overall design of the system can be tested early in the process. A disadvantage is stubs, temporary implementations, need to be created for lower level classes.

Down-top implementation start with the lower level components and proceed up the diagrams. It make the development and testing of of individual components easier. This approach runs the risk of postponing a complete executable program until quite a late stage in implementation.

### Q1 c

An object A can call a method of an object instance B. But object A should not "reach through" object B to access another Object C.

"Don't talk to strangers or principle of least kownledge"

### Q1 f

Subclasses should be able to replace the superclasses without breaking the behavior of system. Subclass should behave in a way that does not break expectations set by parent class.

### Q2 b

Design are often adapted/changed when being implemented. If the model not also updated, it will not match code in the next iteration. 

1. Round-trip Engineering(RTE) 

   RTE is a process in which tools are used to synchronize models and code automatically in both direction.

2. Only one documentation

   Generate most of code directly form doc, making the doc the primary source of truth.

### Q3 b

A class only one instance throughout the lifetime of the application.

```java
public class onlyOne{
    privete static onlyOne instance;
    
    private onlyOne() {
        
    }
    
    public static onlyOne getInstance() {
        if(instance == null) {
            instance = new onlyOne();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

### Q1 b

(a) Boundary: interact with external users

(b) Control: ensure the interaction in the program happen correctly.

(c) Entity: responsible for maintaining data.

### Q1 c

static diagrams describe the properties of the object network can have, it show the structure of system. Such as Class diagram.

Dynamic diagrams describe what happens in the object network, it show the behavior. Such as Sequence diagram

### Q1 e

A concrete class should not serve as a base class for other class. A super class in generalization relationships should be concrete.  Instead, abstract class or interface should be used as foundation for inheritance.

Increased Flexibility; Better Reusability; Reduced Coupling;

### Q1 g

(a) Association

(b) Aggregation

(c) Composition

In Aggregation relationship, body has separate lifecycle and can exist independently of email. Aggregation is a weaker relationship between two object.

In Composition, body is sightly bound to the email and does not exist independently.  Composition is a stronger relationship.

### Q1 h

A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use. Instead of creating a large interface with many interface, it's better to split into smaller.

- Simplicity. Class only need to implement method they need.
- Avoid unnecessary Implementation
- Improved Code clarity and Usability.

### Q2 a

Planned Testing is too late in waterfall model. If a large problem be discovered, it may need to return previous phase and do lot of repeat work. Inflexibility to change due to grid structure in waterfall model. HIgh cost of late changes.

In UP. using iterative development and incremental development. It divide project into iterations. Allow Testing in each of iteration, continuous testing give the frequent feedback, it use for detect error and meet with change easy.

### Q2 b

UP divide a project into Inception, Elaboration, Construction, Transition and organizes work into workflows. UP allows for a variable amount of work to be completed on each activity in an iteration.

### Q3 b

MVC pattern makes a clear distinction between parts of system responsible for maintaining data and presenting data.

Model class responsible for maintaining data.

View Class responsible for presentation data.

Control Class responsible for managing functionality, it links Model and View.

Separation of Concerns, MVC has clear division of roles;

Improved Maintainability; 

Testability; Components can be tested independently.

### Q1 a

Top-down implementation. It start with highest level component and proceeds down follow dependency direction. Overall design of system can be tested earlier in the process. A disadvantage is stubs,  temporary implementation, need to be created for lower level classes. There increased risk of integration issues.

### Q1 b

objects and entities should be open for extending, but close for modification.

Opening module means it could add function/features without modify existing code source.

Closed module means it is stable components, closed module can not be modified.

It makes code flexibility, maintainability, scalability, reusability.

### Q1 c

(a) Association

(b) Aggregation

(c) Composition

Aggregation is lower relationship between entities. Body can exist independent, it has separate lifecycle.

Composition is stronger relationship. In Composition, body is slightly bound to email and it can not exist independently.

### Q1 f

Iterative development focus on the organization  of different activities.

Incremental development focus on the what functionality is developed and when.
